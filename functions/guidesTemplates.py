            1. **Dashboard Overview**:

            2. **Visual Representations**: 
            - Utilize charts and graphs (e.g., pie charts for contract types, bar graphs for renewal timelines) to visually interpret contract data and identify trends or patterns.
            3. **Contract Status Tracking**: 
            - Monitor the status of each contract (active, expiring, or overdue) through color-coded indicators to quickly assess your contract portfolio's health.
            4. **Renewal Predictions**: 
            -  Leverage the analytics to gauge the likelihood of successful contract renewals based on historical data and trends.
            5. **Historical Data Analysis**: 
            - Review past contract performance over time to understand renewal rates and identify which contracts typically require more attention.
            6. **Filtering and Sorting Options**: 
            - Use filtering and sorting tools to drill down into specific contract types, statuses, or time frames, allowing for a more targeted analysis of contract data.
            7. **Export Options**: 
            - Export analytics reports as CSV or PDF files for further analysis or to share with stakeholders, ensuring you can keep everyone informed.
            8. **Actionable Insights**: 
            - Identify actionable insights from the analytics, such as contracts that require renegotiation, impending deadlines, and opportunities for cost savings.
